Reproduced differetn types of exceptions...

2 kinds of Exceptions
-----------------
1) Checked Exceptions -->  Exceptions checked/identified by the compiler.
	Examples:Compiler catch them
		InterruptedException
		IOException
		FileNotFoundException etc.

	--> Can be handled using try..catch block & throws keyword

2) Un-checked Exceptions -->Exceptions which are not checked/identified by compiler
(Run Time) Compiler cannot catch them
 Examples: 
		ArithmeticException
		NullPointerException
		NumberFormatException
		ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

	--> Can be handled only using try..catch

Handle Exceptions..........

try
{
statement which will cause the exception
}
catch(Exception Type)
{
//Recovery steps
}
finally
{

}

case1: Exception occurred, catch block handled ---> finally block will execute
case2: Exception occurred, catch block NOT handled --> finally block will execute
case3: Exception does not occurred, catch block ignored ----> finally block will execute



Throws Keyword for Checked Exceptions only
